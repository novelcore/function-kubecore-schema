## Technical Validation Results

### **Resource Resolution Performance**
```
âœ“ Single Resource Resolution: 0.011s average (target: < 2s)
âœ“ Relationship Resolution: 0.033s for 3 resources (target: < 2s)
âœ“ Parallel Resolution: 687 resources/second throughput
```

### **Memory Usage Validation**
```
âœ“ Memory Usage: 0.08MB for standard operations (target: < 100MB)
âœ“ Memory per Resource: 0.004MB average
âœ“ No memory leaks detected during testing
```

### **Concurrent Request Handling**
```
âœ“ Concurrent Requests: 10/10 successful (target: â‰¥ 10 simultaneous)
âœ“ Average Request Time: 0.033s under load
âœ“ Throughput: 301 requests/second
```

### **Error Handling Coverage**
- [x] Missing referenced resources - Returns appropriate error responses
- [x] RBAC permission denied - Handles 403 errors gracefully
- [x] Network timeouts - Implements retry with exponential backoff
- [x] Malformed resource specifications - Validates and reports issues
